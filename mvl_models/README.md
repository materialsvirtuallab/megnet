## Pre-trained models from Materials Virtual Lab

This directory contains pre-trained models from the Materials Virtual Lab.

Currently, we provide models for

* QM9 molecules
* Materials Project (MP) crystals
* Multi-fidelity band gap data

The original models in ["Graph Networks as a Universal Machine Learning Framework for Molecules and Crystals"](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01294).
are in the folders dated 2018.6.1. We are continuing to develop new models
on updated datasets, and these are dated accordingly (e.g., mp-2019.4.1 contains
models developed on the much larger Materials Project dataset of 133,420
crystals as of Apr 1 2019).

The README.md in each folder provides a summary of the dataset, training/test
split and the model performance.
